        "p1": "Buildora began with a simple observation: Egyptian merchants were struggling to find e-commerce platforms that truly understood their local needs.",
        "p2": "The challenges were clear: complex international payment setups, lack of localized support, and tools that didn't account for how business is actually done on the ground in Egypt.",
        "p3": "We built Buildora (under the QuickStore engine) to bridge this gap. By focusing on local integrations like Instapay and VCash, we've enabled hundreds of merchants to transition from social media selling to professional store ownership."
